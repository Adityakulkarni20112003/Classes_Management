Build a modern, futuristic frontend UI for a Coaching Classes Management System using React.js and Tailwind CSS.

⚠️ Important Guidelines:

Keep the file structure clean and simple.

DO NOT create separate files for basic elements like buttons, cards, inputs — just define them inline or locally within pages/components where needed.

Only create files for major feature components, like:

Student Management

Teacher Management

Course & Batch Management

Exam/Marks

Attendance

Fees

Messaging System

Dashboard

🎨 Design Requirements:

Use a modern theme with futuristic UI (glassmorphism/neumorphism or subtle gradients).

Responsive design for desktop, tablet, and mobile.

Use Tailwind CSS for styling (soft shadows, animated transitions, modern fonts).

Include Framer Motion for component transitions (fade in/out, slide).

Use clean dashboard-style layout with sidebar navigation and summary cards.

📚 Included Modules (with basic mock data):

Dashboard Page

Summary cards: total students, teachers, fees collected, absentees.

Line chart for performance analytics.

✅ Final Tips for AI Code Generator:
Ask the AI to only make major components per page/module.

Use static/dummy data for now.

Apply Tailwind classes directly inside JSX.

Avoid creating Button.jsx, Input.jsx, etc. unless absolutely necessary.
